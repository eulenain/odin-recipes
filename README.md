# odin-recipes

The current project is to showcase what I have learned so far about html.
First I created the directory and the index.html file. I used the boilerplate HTML and added the first heading.

I then created a new directory inside the odin-recipes directory for the pictures I was going to use, plus one for the actual recipes.

Creating a new HTML file within the recipes folder, I named it secret-burger for my special secret burger recipe. I added a heading and then went back in to the index.html file to add the link to the page.

Then I went on to add an image to the index file, as well as to the new recipe page. I formatted the page as requested in the tutorial and also added a "Go back" option to return to the index page.

I also added two more recipes following the same pattern I had done with the first recipe page.

At the end I put the links in an unordered list so that they wouldn't be all in one line.
